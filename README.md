# ETL PROJECT OVERVIEW
To assist Airbnb to accept new homes into their database, our team has been hired to analyze what makes Airbnb popular in certain markets and not so popular in other markets.


# DATASETS
We used 2 different datasets from the public platform Kaggle 
  The following sources for our datasets used:        
     1.	https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data      
     2.	https://drive.google.com/file/d/111VC5lD_0_AGJHzLNlsnYY9upyt0JQAh/view?usp=sharing
    

# TRANSFORMATION
Used Pandas functions in Jupyter Notebook to load two CSV files.
Reviewed the files and transformed into two separate data frames.
Created queries to address our hypothesis by grouping the data by each borough in New York. We compared the number of Airbnb to the total population so we could see where the most popular Airbnbâ€™s were located. 


# SUMMARY
We investigated Airbnb bookings in only one city, New York, and broke down New York by its five boroughs to differentiate Airbnb bookings within the city. We specifically did this to help Airbnb decide which areas they need to accept more hosts compared to other areas where they did not need to accept as many hosts. In conclusion, we realized that Airbnb popularity heavily depends on the popularity of an area.
